The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until itâ€™s too late. (Seymour Cray) Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris. (Larry Wall) A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer. (Bill Gates) Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment. (Kent Beck) Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates)
